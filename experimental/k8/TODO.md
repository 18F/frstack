# TODO


Questions:

- Is there a DNS name for "the proxy host" (for use in Volumes)
     (create a service with no mapping for use by other services)
- Is there a good Ansible / Docker image for provisioning
- how to cache images locally

Need haproxy image for load balancing?


TODO for Demo
   Run DJ/OpenAM on GCE. See if install can be completed manually
   Once above is working, add in ansible

   Local: Get everything working
   Take Screencast


   Install two openam services.  openam-a and openam-b. Have haproxy connect to both.
For summit demo:

   - Install logstash / kibana to show logging?
   -


Can we setup DJ replication auto-magically?


Can we setup OpenAM cluster Automagically?
   Use Ansible to provision the image. Have it "join" the cluster after install?

Could OpenAM config be created on the fly every time?
   Auto expand folder, create link, get bootstrap from env


get a static IP
